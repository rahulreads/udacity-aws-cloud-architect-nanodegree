# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

i-06562f61d56be767c is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.214.
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

This finding is generated only through GuardDuty monitoring traffic on SSH port 22.
When your SSH is configured on different port, this finding will not be generated.


From documentation:

"Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the
following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs"

In this particular case, VPC Flow Logs would show the attack attempts.
