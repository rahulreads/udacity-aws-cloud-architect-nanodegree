Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Based on a EC2 instance CloudFormation provisioning template, IAM Role (InstanceRole) is assigned
to both RecipeWebServiceInstance and AttackInstance. The access to s3 bucket resources for
these two instances has to configured via separate roles with only required permissions for those buckets.

# Poor practice 2
IAM Role can access all S3 buckets, this violates least privilege principle. Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions
performed upon them.

# Poor practice 3
For the VPC configuration, all the route definitions have DestinationCidrBlock defined as 0.0.0.0/0.
This can give attackers advantage in case of a security breach.

# Poor practice 4
The WebAppSG, AppLoadBalancerSG, AttackInstanceSG have both ingress and egress rules
CidrIp as 0.0.0.0/0.

# Poor practice 5
WebAppSG has 5000 and 8080 ports opened. This provides HTTP base communication. As a publicly facing
instance, it should be configured with 443 port for HTTPS based  communications.
