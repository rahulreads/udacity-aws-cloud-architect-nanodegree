Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

[CIS.2.9] Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
[CIS.4.1] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
[CIS.4.2] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389

TCP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
Remove access to all the mentioned ports reachable from the internet
Provide IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Encrypt S3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
